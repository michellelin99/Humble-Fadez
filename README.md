# Humble-Fadez

The client is Kelnitra Robinson, a small business owner located in Nashville, Tennessee running a barber shop by the name of Humble Fadez. The COVID-19 pandemic has put incredible pressure on small businesses to stay afloat during these unfortunate times and the client has struggled with reaching new customers. Currently, she uses her Instagram page, @kelzthabarber, to showcase her talent and her Square site to book appointments. The goal of our project is to help the client gain exposure by creating a visually appealing website for marketing purposes that also allows for engagement with potential customers. The website will have its own domain name and aims to incorporate both her Instagram and Square media into one place. In addition, the website will showcase her abilities and feature her as a barber which will likely add more personality and increase customer satisfaction.


Baseplate Languages and Databases
For our baseplate languages, we will be using the general web development stack, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, which are a mainstay in today's Web Development circles across the entire internet and is supported by all mobile device and browser manufacturers which we expect many of our users to access this website from. Given this we have chosen these three to be our languages of choice to maximize accessibility and usage. This will also provide maximum opportunities for growth given the ever-changing field of web development for the future owners of this project.

For the database we plan on using PostgreSQL which is a database which we are quite familiar with due to our classes and work related activity expertise.

Web Architecture and Framework

For our Web Architecture and framework, we decided to use the Bootstrap library to make our site responsive and mobile-compatible. Given the rise of smartphones, it is integral to build a site that renders our large amount of material and media perfectly on mobile devices. Additionally, we expect many users to access the site from a smartphone, and Bootstrap allows for mobile-first front end development.

For Wireframing, we will be using figma which is an industry standard application that our team will benefit from given the high level of collaboration needed for success. It will also allow us to test concepts and prototypes for our client and receive feedback quickly.

For the version control application we will be using Git/Github to update the changes to the website and make sure that we are documenting our changes whether in code or other parts of this project.
